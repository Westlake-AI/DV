Deep Visualization (DV)
=============
This package contains the code for the paper ''Structure-Preserving and Batch-Correcting Visualization Using Deep Manifold Transformation for Single-cell RNA-Seq Profiles''.

The model can be run by executing main.py in the code directory.

Note
=============
All the algorithms are implemented and run using Pytorch. 

All the experiments are run on a Ubuntu server and a single V100 GPU with 32GB memory.
